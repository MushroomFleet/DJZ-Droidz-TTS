## Implementation Details

### LPC Formant Synthesis
```python
# Example: Enhanced vowel synthesis with precise formants
'IY': LPCParameters(  # heat [i] - F1=270, F2=2290, F3=3010
    coefficients=self._formants_to_lpc([270, 2290, 3010], [40, 80, 120]),
    gain=1.0, pitch_period=180, voicing=1.0, duration=0.14
)
```

### Enhanced Transitions
```python
# Hanning window crossfade for smooth transitions
window = np.hanning(fade_length * 2)
fade_out = window[:fade_length]
fade_in = window[fade_length:]
transition = tail * fade_out + head * fade_in
```

### Formant-to-LPC Conversion
```python
# Convert formant frequencies to LPC coefficients
def _formants_to_lpc(self, formant_freqs, bandwidths):
    # Creates resonant poles at formant frequencies
    # Ensures filter stability and accurate spectral shaping
```
